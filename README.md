An interactive and responsive navigation menu using HTML, CSS and JS. The menu has a fixed position at the top of the viewport, ensuring it remains visible and accessible on all pages.HTML provides a semantic structure for the navigation links and CSS to style the menu's appearance. The menu's dynamic behavior is powered by JS.
I built an interactive and responsive navigation menu using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a dynamic user experience where the menu's style adapts based on user actions.
I used HTML to create a semantic structure for the navigation links. With CSS, I styled the menu and gave it a fixed position so it remains visible at the top of the viewport, ensuring easy access from anywhere on the page. The core of the interactivity was handled by JavaScript. I implemented two key features: a hover effect that changes the background and font color of individual menu items, and a scroll-based event listener that triggers a complete style change for the entire menu once the user scrolls past a certain point on the page.
